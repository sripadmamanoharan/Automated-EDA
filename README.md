# Automated-EDA

This repository provides a tool for performing Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on any dataset with minimal effort. The tool generates comprehensive reports with key insights into the dataset, including summary statistics, data distributions, missing data visualization, correlation analysis, and more.

Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an essential step in any data science project. This tool automates the process by generating visualizations, summary statistics, and insights, allowing data scientists to quickly understand the dataset without manual coding.

Key Features:
Summary statistics for numerical and categorical features.
Visualization of missing values.
Data distribution histograms.
Pairwise correlations and heatmaps.
Outlier detection and handling.
Categorical variable encoding suggestions.
Automated reports in HTML or PDF formats.

Installation
To use this tool, you will need Python installed along with the following libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn plotly missingno
Optionally, for exporting to PDF or HTML, you may need additional libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas-profiling
Clone the Repository
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Automated-EDA.git
cd Automated-EDA
Usage
Once the repository is cloned, you can use the script to perform automated EDA on your dataset:

Place your dataset in a CSV format in the root directory.
Run the following command to generate the EDA report:
bash
Copy code
python automated_eda.py --input_file path/to/dataset.csv --output_format html
The output will be a detailed report in the specified format (HTML or PDF) generated in the reports/ directory.
Command Line Arguments:
--input_file: Path to the input dataset in CSV format.
--output_format: Specify the output format (html or pdf). Default is html.
Example:
bash
Copy code
python automated_eda.py --input_file data/sample_dataset.csv --output_format pdf
Features
The Automated EDA tool provides the following features:

Summary Statistics: Generates summary statistics for numerical and categorical columns.
Missing Data Analysis: Visualizes missing data and provides statistics on missing values.
Data Distribution: Creates histograms and boxplots for numerical features.
Correlation Analysis: Displays a heatmap of correlations between numerical features.
Outlier Detection: Detects outliers using IQR or z-score methods.
Categorical Feature Insights: Provides value counts and suggestions for encoding.
Target Analysis: (If applicable) Performs distribution analysis of the target variable.
